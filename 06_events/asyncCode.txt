DEFAULT:
Javascipt is synchronous(is executed one by one)
It is single thread language


Blocking Code -> block the flow of program -> Read file sync 
Non Blocking code -> does not block execution -> Read File Async 

JS engine -> memory head + call Stack (LIFO)
if Async call is called(eg- settimeout, setinterval) =>
Async call --> Register CallBack --> Task Queue (FIFO) --> call Stack

fetch() -promise-> similar to tast Queue --> call Stack (High Priority)


console.log(1)
settimeout(0, 2)
console.log(3)
=====>  1 3 2 -> first 3 is called then 2 even if timeout is set to 0
